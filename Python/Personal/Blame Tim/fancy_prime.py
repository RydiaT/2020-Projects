# Figures
# to be honest that was all keyboard smash
# Hold on, let me get you another one

# And then we could do advent or rust. Whatever wall you wanna bang your head against.
# 2^19 - 1. I want to know if its prime
# Cool
# Now do 2^107 - 1          I wanna see how big of a number it can handle
# I need it in int form lol
# ** User <<<< Average pow() user
# pow uses an optimized exponention algorithm that can handle modular powers and even take modular inverses
# There's no shot you can convince me that ** is better than pow()

# Cool. I just want one more
# Took it a second but it chugged through it.
# DAMNMNN that was fast
# You have to consider that this is 2^4423-1
# And we were able to check that it's prime in like 2 seconds
# My other test fails because sqrt can't handle a number that big.
# Sad.  I guess you'll just have to check every number up to half of it
# That's only 2^4422 things to check
# Nope, simple division cracks too.

# Isn't Miller-Rabin amazing?
# Ok fine, you've convinced me that it has applications outside of rapid onset insanity ðŸ¤“

# Awesome, now we can do a Diffie-Hellman key exchange

# I thought we were doing Advent or Rust?
# Why not advent in Rust?
# Because I don't hate myself THAT much. But I could be persuaded. :p

# Just think about how much better Rust developers we would be if we solved Advent of Code with it
# We'll be forced to learn ALL the niche concepts with obscure use cases
# ...alright but i REFUSE to use VSC for Rust. Out of princable.

# Okay let's see how well this cross-IDE stuff handles

# where the hell is my thumbdrive with all my projects
# my pc won't show it anymore

# Remove it and plug it back in
# Ayyy. Stupid cheap peice of crap. That acronym is rough to use lol.
# It could have been construed in the not nice way

# What year do you wanna do?
# Lets roll a number between the start and the end of AoC
# I think the first year was 2015
